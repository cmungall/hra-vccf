Notes: 

1) The BodySubPart and BodySubPartID fields in the Vessels.csv file are no longer being updated. This has been moved to the new VesselOrganCrosswalk.csv file and expanded. Please use this file for the most recent mappings.

2) FMA IDs are now in the format "FMA:NNNNN" instead of "fmaNNNNN" to align with other Human Reference Atlas (HRA) files.

3) The format of values in the ReferenceDOI field now algins with the new Reference ID format used in the HRA ASCT+B tables.
